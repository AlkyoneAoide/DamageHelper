A helper library for damage-related functions.

Made for [immersive-weapons](https://github.com/AlkyoneAoide/immersive-weapons) so that there isn't a ton of mixin functions distracting from the rest of the project.

Much code yoinked from [CriticaLib](https://github.com/hamusuke0323/CriticaLib), thank you <3

Features:
- Easy on-crit functions for custom items
- Selective (per entity and per damage source) immunity
- Modify max health per-player (saved across world/server restarts)
